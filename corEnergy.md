I have lived my whole life in a city called Monte grande, nearby the airport in which I work. 
Technology has always been of my interest and a few month ago I bumped into the full-stack web developer course while I was wandering the internet seeking mainly technology-related careers.
And so, after a few weeks of meditating it, I decided to enroll myself for the course.
